To Recruiters,

I have excluded Unity-specific files, as well as asset files, so as to avoid clutter and size. The full repository (minus third party libraries) is available upon request.
I have excluded a small number of scripts that were from third party libraries, of which I am not authorized to make publically available.
Third party scripts represent a small fraction of the codebase and were heavily modified to meet my specific business needs.
All third-party scripts can be shown in the case of an interview, as well as a demo of the finished product.

Thank you,
Matthew Caponi.
